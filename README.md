# CoppeR

### Intro
This package is basically inspired by Hilary Parker's [cat](https://github.com/hilaryparker/cats) package that gives you a random cat picture in your R console and her [blog post](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) on writing a really simple R package.

### Purpose
When you are down and R is not being fun, run this function to get a picture of my miniature tan dachshund called Copper. He is great. 

```{r}
# load in devtools or ghit
library("devtools") # or
library("ghit")

# install the CoppeR package
install_github('padpadpadpad/CoppeR')

# load the package
library('CoppeR')

# get pictures of Copper!
get_coppeR()

```
